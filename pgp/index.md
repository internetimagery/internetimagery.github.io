# Secure contact

In a worrying world of internet privacy breaches, it has become common to use encryption for everyday messaging. Below you can find a [Lock (otherwise known as a PGP Public Key)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5FEqGYLL0o) to contact me through. Feel free to use this for anything from trivial messages to more elaborate sensitive information (your eyes only kinda deal).

If you are unfamiliar with the concept. Have a look at the link above, and [download the application for your operating system here,](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html) or [install a browser extension from here.](https://www.mailvelope.com/)
