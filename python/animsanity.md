## Anim Health Check

Animation is complicated. So many factors rely on other factors, and it can be tricky to keep on top of it all.

Computers are no good at acting (which is a good thing! Job securtiy!) so they cannot animate for us. However there are a few little repetitive tasks cleaning animation curves that can be computerized!

This tool attempts to address some of them. Allowing you to focus on the performance and keep your sanity!

To install the tool download from the link below. Drag and drop the file into the Maya viewport.

You will get a new shelf icon in whichever shelf is currently active.

####To use the tool:

* Click the shelf icon. You will get a new window popup.
* Select the controllers / objects you wish to check.
* (Optional) Select specific channels in the channelbox or graph editor that you want to check. Do this if you only want to check a few channels.
* (Optional) Select a frame range in the timeslider to check in. If you do not do this, the tool will check within the total range currently active. If you want to check the whole animation, be sure to zoom the time slider out to cover it all.
* Click the "Check Animation" button. You will get the results updated.
* Click any of the "show" buttons to highlight the affected keyframes in the graph editor. You can then fix them from there.
* (Optional) You can also click the "Fix it!" button to allow the tool to do the fixing. This is convenient and the tool is pretty good at fixing the animation without altering your curves. But when in doubt, always fix the issues yourself.
