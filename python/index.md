# Code Snippets, Scripts and Tools

Below are a number of small utility tools I've created. Most of them for Maya.

Have a peek. :)

### Tools

Fully blown functional and useful tools.

### Scripts

Brief single purpose helpers.

* [Movable Parent Constraint](parentconstraint)
* [IK-Like Orient Constraint](orientconstraint)
* [Python2Mel](py2mel)

### Snippets

Few lines of code. Pieces of the puzzle!

* [Simple Error Reporter](err_report)
* [Animated Images in Maya](animated_images)
* [Maya dockable window Template](docking_window)
* [Autoload modules](autoload)
* [Dict Snippets](dict)
* [Iteration Snippets](iterate)
* [Utility Snippets](utility)
