# Code Snippets, Scripts and Tools

Below are a number of bits and bobs I've created. May they help you in times of need.

### Tools

Fully blown functional and useful tools.

* __Out Of Control__ Rig Work In Progress!
* Clip Store
* Attribute Snap
* Twin Skeleton
* Game Anim Export
* License Fix
* Todo
* [File Lock](filelock) - Lock a maya scene file while it is in use to prevent people stepping on each others toes. Suitable for working in shared environments, such as a local network or dropbox.
* Spaces
* [Constraint key](constraintkey) - Key one object to another as though it were a constraint.
* [Click Time](clicktime) - Time out animations organically.
* [Anim Sanity](animsanity) - Save your sanity! Give your animation curves a health check.
* [Remote Textures](remotetextures) - Automatically download textures if urls are supplied.

### Scripts

Brief single purpose helpers. Useful.

* [Curve Combiner](curvecombine) - Combine multiple nurbs curves into one curve.
* [Constraint Switcher](switchconstraint) - Add a new attribute with a drop down list that switches constraints. Simple!
* [Movable Parent Constraint](parentconstraint) - Parent constraint remaining adjustable.
* [IK-Like Orient Constraint](orientconstraint) - Aim constraint setup.
* [Time Constraint](timeconstraint) - Parent constraint with the added option of offsetting time.
* [Python2Mel](py2mel) - Turn python source file into a compact mel command.

### Snippets

Few lines of code. Pieces of the puzzle!

* [Simple Error Reporter](err_report)
* [Animated Images in Maya](animated_images)
* [Maya dockable window Template](docking_window)
* [Autoload modules](autoload)
* [Dict Snippets](dict)
* [Iteration Snippets](iterate)
* [Utility Snippets](utility)
