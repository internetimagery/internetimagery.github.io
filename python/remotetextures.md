## Remote Textures

When you're quickly roughing something out in Maya it can be beneficial to pop online and find a texture that is somewhat suitable.

Sure downloading the texture and adding it is not hard. But why not make it easier?!

To install the tool download from the link below. Drag and drop the file into the Maya viewport.

__DOWNLOAD THE SCRIPT HERE: <download>remote_texture</download>__

The tool will sit happily running in the background.

To use the tool:

* Go online and find the image you want to use.
* Open the image in the browser and copy the link. This means linking to the image itself and not the google search results. Links ending in ".jpg" ".png" etc are good candidates.
* Create or Edit a materials texture. Where you would put the path to the file, instead paste the web link.
* (Optional) If you open the script editor, you can watch the progress of the download.
