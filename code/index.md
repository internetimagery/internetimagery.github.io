# Code Snippets, Scripts and Tools

Below are a number of bits and bobs I've created. May they help you in times of need.

## General Tools

* [Simple Input Tabs](http://get-simple.info/extend/plugin/simple-input-tabs/523/) - A simple way to add different content placement in templates ([For GetSimple CMS](http://get-simple.info/)). [Even your mum can do it!](http://internetimagery.com/simple_input_tabs/#)

* [GO](https://internetimagery.github.io/go) - A simple browser Go board. Keeps track of the game, not the score etc. Share links with people to provide the board state.

* [Folder Process](folder-process) - Compress videos and rename photos in one step.

* [Photopack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/photopack) - Use modern compression to pack photos into and out of a video. Either as a space saving archive, or to send to someone.

## Maya Tools

### Tools

Fully blown functional and useful tools.

* __Out Of Control__ Rig Work In Progress!
* [Clip Store](clipstore) - Pose library focusing on flexibility.
* [Twin Skeleton](twinskeleton) - For creating consistent "dummy" rigs beneath more advanced rigs. Suitable for games. Useful in other rigging tasks also.
* [Game Anim Export](gameanimexport) - Managing game animations in Maya scenes.
* [License Fix](licensefix) - Reduce the number of Student popups in the student version of Maya to reasonable levels.
* [Todo](todo) - Todo task list, and file versioning in one!
* [File Lock](filelock) - Lock a maya scene file while it is in use to prevent people stepping on each others toes. Suitable for working in shared environments, such as a local network or dropbox.
* [Constraint key](constraintkey) - Key one object to another as though it were a constraint.
* [Click Time](clicktime) - Time out animations organically.
* [Anim Health Check](animsanity) - Save your sanity! Give your animation curves a health check.
* [Remote Textures](remotetextures) - Automatically download textures if urls are supplied.
* [Attribute Snap](attributesnap) - Constraint like system for custom attributes.

### Scripts

Brief single purpose helpers. Useful.

* [Shape Control](shapecontrol) - Replace rig controllers with pickable model sections.
* [Curve Combiner](curvecombine) - Combine multiple nurbs curves into one curve.
* [Constraint Switcher](switchconstraint) - Add a new attribute with a drop down list that switches constraints. Simple!
* [Movable Parent Constraint](parentconstraint) - Parent constraint remaining adjustable.
* [IK-Like Orient Constraint](orientconstraint) - Aim constraint setup.
* [Time Constraint](timeconstraint) - Parent constraint with the added option of offsetting time.
* [Python2Mel](py2mel) - Turn python source file into a compact mel command.

### Snippets

Few lines of code. Pieces of the puzzle!

* [Simple Error Reporter](err_report)
* [Animated Images in Maya](animated_images)
* [Maya dockable window Template](docking_window)
* [Autoload modules](autoload)
* [Dict Snippets](dict)
* [Iteration Snippets](iterate)
