## Folder Process

Processing photos and videos to save space for backups and to keep things organized is a pain. Here is a simple drag and drop option!

Download the file here and run it!

__<download>folder-process</download>__

This tool does three things:

* Renames all photos and videos to match the name of the folder they are in.
* Compresses all photos without affecting noticeable quality.
* Compresses all videos into h264 mp4 format, again for space saving.

To use it, run the tool. A window with a giant folder will pop up. Simply drag and drop any folder full of photos onto the program to process them!
