                Compromised mostly of people I'd worked with while contracted to Whitegloves. Our small team created a couple of short films. Modeling, rigging and animating. Decently long hours and plenty of overnighters. Ah yes, those things!

                Jumped into a small family resturaunt and bar, co-serving with a good friend. A southafrican bar ment a diverse cultural customer mix, and presented certain communication challenges to overcome. Retail certainly helped with that. :)
                Due to the small size of the shop, the job involved wearing many hats behind the bar and out at tables.

                Everyone needs a taste of retail! Sales role in an electronics store. I would like to say that I was the top salesman (that hat goes to a chinese guy that said "yes" to everyone, leading to many returns!), however most of my time ended up being spent fixing technical issues for customers and staff alike.
                The position also involved sorting out couriers and processing orders, dealing with finance companies, organizing service callouts and facilitating equipment rentals.

                Gave me my first taste of Autodesk Maya. A great course lazer focused on Animation, taught by many professionals currently working in the largest studios in the world. On the side I learned Python and scripted up a number of tools that students have used since. I have also contributed to the community with The Great Pose a day Challenge.

                A three year Diploma in 3D character animation. Turns out it included more of a generalist approach. Learning Modeling, Rigging, and Lighting above and beyond Animation. Also included a first year of 2D Animaition, and conitinued to provide Life Drawing throughout. I recieved the Diploma and the top overall prize for the graduating year at the ceremony.
