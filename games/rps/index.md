# Rock Paper Snap

A clever twist on the traditional games of Snap and Rock Paper Scissors. _Quick hands are the name of the game!_
Instead of matching two of the same card, you must _"SNAP"_ when the newly placed card beats the one below in a rock-paper-scissors matchup. Another prototype I'm working on, as both a digital game and also physical cards.

I've done all art, design, etc etc... exception being music.
