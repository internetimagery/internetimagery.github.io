# Go Board

#### [Play the game here!](/go)

A simple representation of the game of Go.

Notable features:

* Runs entirely in browser. The files can be downloaded and run offline also.
* Game state is tracked in the URL. This means sharing games becomes as easy as copy / pasting a link to friends.
* Loads SGF files (drag file onto board). Take your favourite game and view it, or play it here. Perhaps migrate to this Board from an existing server game.

Have fun!
