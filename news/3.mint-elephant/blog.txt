You know those times your partner is sleeping, and talking. Sometimes they reply?

Sometimes, when talking to them... you can insert weird things into the dream...

Meet Mint. The Elephant born in a dream that makes a living happily crushing peanuts!

Drawn on paper, and photographed using a normal tripod. First traditional animation I've done in years (even if it is just a simple cycle, and far from perfect)! Testing out a new drawing board I made for hobby traditional animation stuff. Fun!

...and here is Mint splayed all over the ground. In pieces! Why? Because I can. I love the tactile nature of the traditional medium.
