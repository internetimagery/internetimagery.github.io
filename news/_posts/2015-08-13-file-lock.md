Working collaboratively can be tricky. Especially with the possibility of stepping on each others toes. So here we have a method of locking maya files as they're being used.

Using it simple.

#### You can download the script here: <download>file_lock</download>

Simply download the file. Drag and drop it into Maya.

From this point on, a file (same name as the scene file with ".lock" extension) will appear.
If someone else tries to load the same file it will provide a warning that the file is being used.

Thats it... pretty straight forward. Hope it helps! :)
