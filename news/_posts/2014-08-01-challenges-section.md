I've added a new section to the site. A challenges section. Which is planned to become full of… you guessed it. *Challenges!*<!-- more -->

----

Kicking it off is [The Great Daily Pose Challenge](https://plus.google.com/events/ct7kupika1mm709r1eitgb2vrlg).


>To become a master artist, you must throw away 10,000 bad drawings. So too in CG animation. Planned on spending a 3 hours animating today? Spend  2 hours 50 minutes on animation work and knock off another one of your 10,000 bad poses.
>
>THE CHALLENGE:
>
>Each day, create and upload a rendered pose. You don't have to include the source of the pose, but you can if you like. Weekend poses optional.
>
>The rendering can be a simple screen shot of Maya. A three point lighting setup, or a fully lit and composited image. It doesn't matter. However keep in mind these are essentially "throw away" poses. So don't spend more time here than on your animations!﻿

You'll find it under the wrecking ball button!
