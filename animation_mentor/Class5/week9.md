####[Animation. The big Three](http://blog.digitaltutors.com/big-three-character-animation/)

>Character animation can be challenging. Your character might be required to move in a complex way, which is often accompanied with micro movements, e.g., subtle nuances that are added to convey realism. If not planned carefully, advanced animation can easily get out of control, which results in an excessive use of keyframes that eventually become unmanageable in the FCurve Editor, and a performance that is undesirable, to say the least.

Some nice little tips. Helpful workflow stuff.
