####[Cool interview with Glen Keane](http://www.skwigly.co.uk/glen-keane-interview/)

>Glen Keane – the Man, the Legend, the Animator – was in the UK recently to promote his latest masterpiece Duet (an interactive short film commissioned by Google as part of their Advanced Technology Projects). In anticipation of this exciting project’s upcoming release in the coming months, Skwigly took the opportunity talk nonchalantly about how awesome he is.

A nice interview with the amazing Glen Keane!
