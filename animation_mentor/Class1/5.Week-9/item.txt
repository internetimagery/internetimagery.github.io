###Week Nine!

How is your walk going? Hopefully well. Not too many nightmares running and endless corridor from a ball with legs I hope.


####Animation Physics dedicated to walks.

There is a lot of information here on the science of walks. It's great information to think of how a walk works mechanically. Animation is an art, and that is important. But we can't forget that things still need to have some anatomy and physicality to them. Some visual link to the world we accept as reality.

Keep working and you'll get it. If you're stuck, don't be afraid to scrap it and start again. You will ALWAYS recreate it faster the second time, and learn more in the process. It's also much faster to recreate something as simple as a ball with legs now, than make the same mistakes again later on while animating a full on character.

So redo it if you feel you have to and have no fear.
