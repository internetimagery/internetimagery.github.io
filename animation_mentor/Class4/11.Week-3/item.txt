Three down...

####[Clear Silhouette](http://www.animstudy.com/p/appealingposes102lineofaction.html)

>I was thinking at the beginning, "why the heck should I need to care about a silhouette ?" ... "I'm doing animations which will be rendered beautifully,... but still why my mentor keep pushing me to maintain a good silhouette ?"

Lest we forget.

####[Cameras and Lighting](http://www.expertrating.com/courseware/MAYACourse/MAYA-Cameras-Lighting-3.asp)

>MAYA Tutorial - Cameras and Lighting

A basic run down of lights and their attributes. Perhaps a little early to think about lighting but lets have a lighting week anyway!

####Ambient Occlusion lighting trick

A cool trick to simulate lighting without having to light. Not an amazing output but better than default rendering and easy to do!

[There is also another way of doing this more universally if you're happy with white.](http://www.samwirch.com/blog/simple-ambient-occlusion-render-maya-2012)

####Volumetric Lights

Another cool trick for fog, or mood lighting. Again a simple trick, and not to the quality of a simulation. But good enough for an animation scene!
