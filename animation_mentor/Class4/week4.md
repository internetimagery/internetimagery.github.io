#### [How does Cognition influence emotion](http://cnx.org/content/m50397/latest/)

>How do our thoughts influence our emotions? Most of thought is unconscious - beliefs, goals, drives, appraisals, attitudes, and even changes in emotional processes (such as fluctuations in feeling) all can be conscious or unconscious to different degrees. But are these processes subjective or objective? Do some people respond to situations or behave more 'logically' than other people? Are there a few 'core' emotions that are the main contributors to our thoughts and the way we feel? Pleasure and pain might be behind our emotional drives, while more complex feelings would be the result of the other basic emotions. Psychology is a subjective subject, however it is possible to measure the emotional reactions that people have from their brains' mental processes (thoughts, behaviors, attitudes beliefs, etc).

A rather long read. Have a skim through.
