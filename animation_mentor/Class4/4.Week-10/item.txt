>Maybe it's too obvious but keyboard shortcuts make really a HUGE difference. I'm using my software for a few years already and I'm still discovering new shortcuts that are significantly improving my workflow. Don't get yourself limited with defaults only.

>Lip Sync is the process of matching up the audio sound track of a character talking or singing to the drawings. This is done by "breaking down the track" using an editing software such as Adobe Premier and writing the sounds onto a set of exposure sheets. The exposure sheets are set up so that each frame of film is represented by a line into which the sound being made can be written. These sounds can then correspond to specific drawings that represent the mouth positions.

>The following is a list of things that need to be considered while animating lip sync.
