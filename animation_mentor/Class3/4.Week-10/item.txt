####[3 Speeds](http://blog.navone.org/2007/09/3-speeds.html)

>Something I heard back when I was first learning animation that still really helps me to this day: always try to get three speeds in your shot. Put in slow moves, medium moves, and fast moves. This will help give your shot texture, interest, and emphasis.

I've put this up before, but it's worth repeating. It's easy when trying to get the weight to feel right, to simply make everything feel the same weight. Mix it up!

####[Studying the Masters. Grab and Shake.](http://www.animatorisland.com/studying-the-masters-grab-and-shake/#more-2763)

>Two “Studying the Masters” posts in a row?! Yes, despite normally spreading them out, today we’re going to take a look at another clip right on the heels of last week’s in order to contrast them and give you some examples of what NOT to do!

A nice little critique of some classic animation. Feel free to agree and / or disagree with some points.

#### Tracking Spheres

Sometimes what you want to track, is not a control directly.
