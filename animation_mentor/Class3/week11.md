####[Acting in animation](http://www.animationarena.com/acting-and-animation.html)

>"An animator is an actor with a pencil", goes the oldest and truest animation cliché. Not "a draftsman that acts", but first and foremost - an actor. If you're trying to tell a story through a character, inevitably you're an actor. The only question is whether you are a good actor or a bad one.

A small reminder that while it takes a certain skill making things move. It isn't enough to make a character. They have to have a personality and mood as well.

####[Personality in Animation](http://animationsupplement.com/index.php/articles/38-personality-animation)

>Yes, Personality animation has to do things with a CHARACTER. A Character could be anything. It can be a chair, lamp, tree, animal or a human.  A character’s personality is all about who the character is; how he thinks, how he acts, and probably most importantly: how he reacts to the things that are happening around him, to him, and to the other characters around him.”

Don't forget to portray a personality!
