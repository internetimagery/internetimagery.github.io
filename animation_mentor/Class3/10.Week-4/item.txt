####[100 resources for film makers](http://www.theblackandblue.com/2013/01/08/100-resources-even-more/)

>How many resources exist for filmmakers? Surely after I had found 100 Resources and then 100 More Resources, there wouldn’t be anything left. At least, that’s what I kept telling myself.

>But that’s the beautiful thing about the Internet and the film community — it’s growing and not slowing down anytime soon.

>So I’ve reached back into the well and found another 100 resources perfect for filmmakers, cinematographers, camera assistants, and just about anyone who has ever stepped on a film set.

>I suggest you bookmark this post to keep it as a reference — it’s full of great info.

Loads of resources. wow... o.o

####[Using triangles to improve composition](https://www.expertphotography.com/triangles-improve-your-composition/)

>Triangles are a great way of combining different compositional techniques such as lines and paths and using them to create a more interesting part of a photograph, but the best part about using a triangle is their ability to make a photo feel stable or unstable.

Forget the trigonometry. This is how to deal with triangles!

####[Removing the Student window on references](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Installation-Hardware-OS/Why-does-Student-Version-information-appear-when-I-purchased-a/m-p/4177275#M4470)

>However, instead of deleting the line 'fileInfo "license" "student";', replace "student" with "education". This is essentially what happens for files that are opened in the Educational version of the software. As of now, I'm using this method and there seems to be no problem.

When referencing in many student built objects and saving the file you have to click ok to the student message for each individual item. Doing this to each .ma file will reduce that number to one.

####[How to study animation](http://theloztboyz.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-i-study-animation.html)

>If studying in school is essential to getting good grades, couldn't you say the same for creating good animation?  If you truly want to have better animation, you need to study.  More importantly, do you know HOW TO STUDY?  When I was a kid, getting good grades never came easy to me.  No matter how much I read through all the material, I would still do poorly on my tests.  It wasn't until my Mom showed me HOW TO STUDY, that things changed.  I came upon the same realization very early in my career.  I remember comparing my animations to the first Monsters Inc. Teaser.  You know, the one where they stumble out of the closet.   In comparison, my animations looked like dog shit, and despite my best efforts, they were staying that way.  I had hit the all-demoralizing plateau.  I just sat there and stared at the teaser, as if looping it over and over again was going to somehow magically infuse my brain with the talents it took to create it.

Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime.

Being taught animation is great. But at the end of the day, you need to be able to study by yourself.

####[Society for Animation Studies](http://ww2.animationstudies.org/)

>The Society for Animation Studies (SAS) is an international organization dedicated to the study of animation history and theory.

An interesting organization with a matching blog!
