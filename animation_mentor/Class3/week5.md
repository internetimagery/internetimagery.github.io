####[Five things to do before starting a shot](http://animation.about.com/od/otherusefultutorials/a/5-Things-To-Do-Before-You-Ever-Start-Animating.htm)

>Ever tried to start an animation from scratch without planning a single thing? I'm guessing it ended in disaster. When we get a new idea, it's tempting to dive right in and start scribbling frame after frame, but more often than not we end up wandering off the beaten path with no idea where we're going. Slowing down isn't much fun, but it'll save your project in the end. To help keep yourself in order, try following these five simple steps before you get started.

Always good to refresh that beginning workflow!

####[Dreamworks Production Process](http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/insidedwa/productionprocess)

>Have you ever wondered how our films are made? As you might imagine, it takes a lot of people and a lot of time - 3 to 5 years in most cases to bring one of our films to the big screen.

Just a cool little web page. We'll all get there!

####[Timing, the animation Principal](http://www.animationbrain.com/timing-2d-animation-principle.html)

>It is the number of inbetweens between two keys. Timing is the essence of everything we do in animation. How slow or how fast an object or character moves helps define that object or character. - See more at: http://www.animationbrain.com/timing-2d-animation-principle.html#sthash.MQqbMLzl.dpuf

A nice little writeup on timing. Do not forget your timing!

####[Keyframe Calculator](http://www.csgnetwork.com/animationkeycalc.html)

>This calculator doesn't go into the concept of keyframe animation, but assumes the user has an understanding of it already. The default FPS(Frames per second) values are set at 24fps or standard animation, and 30fps which is generally accepted as the framerate for television. The user can decide which strategy they will use for plotting their keyframes. This calculators' output is formatted to be used in to be used in Maya 3D

An interesting calculator. Could be useful!
