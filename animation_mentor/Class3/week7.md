####[Fostering a fearless culture is key to groundbreaking creative work.](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/05/02/creativity-inc-ed-catmull-book/)

>Make New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody’s ever made before

A nice look into failure, and how it should be treated.

####[Body language cheat sheet](http://theinformationdump.tumblr.com/post/44418360041/body-language-cheat-sheet-for-writers-as)

>All body language must be considered in context, but if you've set your scene and established your characters, a little body language can help.

A nice cheat sheet for some simple body language ideas, based off simple emotions.

####[Emotion Amplifiers](http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78517219/Emotion%20Amplifiers%202.pdf)

>As writers, our job is to create a meaningful emotional experience for readers. One of the best ways to do this is to convey the quality and depth of our characters’ feelings through their thoughts, body language, and visceral reactions.

A nice reference guide for emotion amplifiers.

####[Another Body Language Cheat Sheet](http://writerswrite.co.za/cheat-sheets-translate-emotions-into-written-body-language)

>We are always told to use body language in our writing. Sometimes, it's easier said than written. I decided to create these cheat sheets to help you show a character's state of mind. Obviously, a character may exhibit a number of these behaviours. For example, he may be shocked and angry, or shocked and happy. Use these combinations as needed.

More body language!

####[Simple Collisions without Dynamics](http://mayastation.typepad.com/maya-station/2009/05/create-simple-collisions-without-dynamics.html)

>In this example, the cam and the plane are connected by a couple of constraints. It's almost as accurate as a dynamic simulation but much faster to tweak.

Something more technical. Simple collisions without the hassle of simulations.

Finally this is not a link, nor is it a free item. But it's worth looking into getting the book "Emotion Thesaurus". Google will find a result near you!
