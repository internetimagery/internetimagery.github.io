####[Brendon Body's Walk Tutorial](http://brendanbody.blogspot.co.nz/2008/12/walk-cycle.html)

>One of the last things I did this term at Duncan of Jordanstone was give a Maya animation workshop, where I showed how to go about creating a basic walk cycle. I won't go into too much detail here, but will just show my approach to it. The following technique can be applied to many different walk cycles.

Another Walk Cycle tutorial. This has some nice information on weight shift and successive breaking of joints. Do keep in mind it is for a female walk cycle.

####[The Gait Guys](http://thegaitguys.tumblr.com/post/72553246708/so-you-want-to-do-a-gait-analysis-part-1-from)

>From casual observation to a computer driven model, before you can know what may be wrong with a gait, you need to know what is right. Knowing what is happening at each phase of the gait cycle is essential. This series will explore just that and provide you with an overview of what should be happening.

The Gait Guys have some great videos breaking down walks. They also go over a lot of issues people can have with walks, and how to spot them. Their entire blog contains good info, but this piece is a nice overview of how they go over a walk.
